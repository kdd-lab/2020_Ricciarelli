# Datasets

This directory hosts the datasets I used for the tasks that were assigned to 
me. 
* The file *weighted_academic_graph.txt* represents a weighted multi directed
network. In this network, every node is a State, while every edge represents a 
researcher that has tripped from a State to another in a particular year. Each
edge contains some information about the trip, like the year in which it has
taken place and the edge's weight, which represents the number of times the 
researcher as tripped from State A to State B in that particular year.
* The *weighted_coauthors_networks* subdirectory contains the network analysis
statistics and the visualizations for the coauthors networks. The files are
divided by decade, from 1950 to 2010.
* The *Zenodo* subdirectory contains the summary statistics for the 
OpenAIRE Research Graph dumps, that can be downloaded via 
[this link](https://zenodo.org/record/3516918#.Xnt-mtNKgp9).
